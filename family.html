  Family has always been important to me.<br> 
  I grew up in a close-knit family. We try our best to stay in contact and help each other when needed.<br> 
   Over the years I have learned that no matter the length of time you go without seeing your family, when you do it just like the good old days.<br>
   As I look in this picture i can see the love between a daughter and her father.
